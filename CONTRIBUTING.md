I appreciate each contribution. Isn't there that other thing you need to do?

# Conventional Commits

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```gitcommit
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

In general, scope will be some [package(s)](/docs/stow-packages.md#stow-packages).

**FAQ: Do all my contributors need to use the Conventional Commits specification?**

No! If you use a squash based workflow on Git lead maintainers can clean up the
commit messages as theyâ€™re merged - casual committers shouldn't let it get in
the way.

# Branches

Branches should be named as follows:

```
<type>/<scope>
```

Again, scope will generally be some [package(s)](/docs/stow-packages.md#stow-packages).

**Do whatever is easiest at the time. Feel free to push straight to master.**
